  headline: Covid-19 and the Black Death by Sydney Collyns
  content: In this episode, host Sydney Collyns examines the causes and effects of the fourteenth century Black Death, and then juxtaposes it with the current pandemic testing humanity, Covid-19. Striking similarities are revealed in terms of the catalysts, quarantine strategies, and scapegoating of both public health crises. Sydney ends with a discussion on the significant long-term improvements of Western civilization due to the plague, and offers some insights about what the social, political, and economic impacts of the coronavirus will be.
